* Sprouts game board

Sprouts is yet another game invented by John Conway!  There is an
article about it in [[http://nrich.maths.org/2413][Sprouts Explained : nrich.maths.org]].

** Installation

To install, you also need a prepared copy of [[http://paperjs.org/][Paper.js]].  I keep mine in
the =js/= subdirectory of the Web site: adjust to taste!

** Usage

To play, get the mouse near a sprout (not on the sprout itself, I
reserve this for something else), then click and drag near another (or
the same) sprout.  To re-initialize the game, reload the page.

** Justification

This is an tiny exercise for me to play with =paper.js= and JavaScript,
which I publish a bit prematurely for the sake of collaboration.  The
tool is still very modest, a lot of details are missing, big and
small.
