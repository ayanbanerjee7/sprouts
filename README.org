* Sprouts game board

This is an tiny exercise for me to play with =pretty.js= and JavaScript,
which I publish a bit prematurely for the sake of collaboration.  The
tool is still very modest, a lot of details are missing, big and
small.

You need a prepared copy of [[http://paperjs.org/][Paper.js]].  I keep mine in the =js/=
subdirectory of the Web site: adjust to taste!

To play, get the mouse near a sprout (not on the sprout itself, I
reserve this for something else), then click and drag near another (or
the same) sprout.  To re-initialize the game, reload the page.
